				<p>To pay fines by cash, check, or credit card, first visit the Library Circulation Desk to get a statement.  You can then take that statement to the Business Services Office in Portable 48 (across from the parking structure, next to the SOC Building).  After paying, bring proof of payment, back to the Library Circulation Desk so your payment can be recorded and any holds removed.</p>
			
				<p>Fines over $5.00 will result in a hold being placed on your record.  You will not be able to register for classes until you have paid your library fines and fees and payment has been recorded at the circulation desk.</p>
			
				<p>If you have questions, please contact the Library Circulation Desk at (916)-691-7266.</p>
